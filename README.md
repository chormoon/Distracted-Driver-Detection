Set the directory as the working directory, import the data.
Notice that I change the data stucture myself. I set a 'valid' direcory and move 30 pictures from each dirctories in 'test'. It have the same structure with the 'test'
Then you can run the 'DriverCode.ipynb' in 'src' directory.
If you want to see how I eda it, run the file in 'EDA' directory.
